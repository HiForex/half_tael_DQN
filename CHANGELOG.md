## Broadcast

### Tentative Goals for Scrum Meeting #2 on 2019-07-24
* **Goals**:
    * **Henry**
        * Implement trading interface.
        * Write user manual on such trading interface.
        * Draft version control standard and contribution guideline.
    * **Steven**
        * Run a trial DQN model on any `USD_JPY` file in [./dummy_data](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/tree/master/arena_data).
    * **Jian**
        * Help Steven on building the basic DQN model.
        * Quantified Anita's personality on trading behavior.
        * Research some high-end DQN structure and make a presentation.



### Upcoming Meetings:
* **2019-07-19 | Scrum | Henry, Jian, Steven** ‚Äî Checkout **Meeting** section for details.


### 2019-07-10 | A short style guide for updating this `CHANGELOG.md`.
* The `CHANGELOG.md` has three sections.
    * **Broadcast**: Briefing of upcoming events or reminders (like this one).
    * **Meeting**: Summaries for meetings.
    * **Development Journal**: Records for development updates.
* For the sake of consistency, I suggest we update this `CHANGELOG.md` in a date descending order (new-to-old) with a headline format of `YYYY-MM-DD | Highlight | Name`. Note the `Highlight` and `Name` parts can be omitted if not applicable, e.g.
    * This broadcast headline, which omits `Name`.
    * Under **Development Journal** as `2019-04-10 | Henry Zhong`, which omits `Highlight`.

## Meeting

### 2019-07-26 | Scrum #3 | Henry, Jian, Steven
* **Goals**:
    * **Henry & Steve**
        * Integrate the trial DQN model with custom backend.
    * **Henry**
        * Finish basic DQN learning.

### 2019-07-24 | Scrum #2 | Henry, Jian, Steven


### 2019-07-19 | Scrum #1 | Henry, Steven
* **Goals**
    * **ALL**:
        * Get familiar with basic Q-learning and DQN concept in general.
    * **Henry**:
        * Build a basic wrapper to communicate with [OANDA](https://www.oanda.com/us-en/) API as the backend of the project. Anul's code [`Oanda_Trader.py`](placeholder) can be use as reference.
    * **Steven**:
        * Run a trial DQN model on ~~SP 500~~ [`USD_JPY_0.csv`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/dummy_data/USD_JPY_0.csv).
            * Task change due to CSV file of foreign exchange between USD and JPY is easily obtainable -- Henry.
    * **Jian**:
        * ~~Research and present some insight regarding the possible designs of DQN model.~~
        * Understand the concept of [Anita](https://www.graphen.ai/dev/anita/), and define a quantified standard for "trading personality" according to [Mapping Personality Traits to Investment Behavior (Revised)](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/legacy_ref/anita/Mapping%20Personality%20Traits%20to%20Investment%20Behavior%20(Revised).pptx) and [Strategies and Metrics.xlsx](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/blob/master/legacy_ref/anita/Strategies%20and%20Metrics.xlsx)
            * Task change due to update form Dr. Lin regarding [Anita](https://www.graphen.ai/dev/anita/). As "trading bot with personalities" is the unique selling point of this project, we should only research in designs which are compatible with such idea. Thus we should quantify the concept of "trading personality" first -- Henry.


* **Review**
    * **Henry**
        * ‚úÖ Delivered by [commit `ac4d217`](https://github.com/choH/half_tael_DQN/commit/ac4d21741ae3a7c45a16025de1a4b93b42891e39).
        * ‚ùå üöß Work-in-progress on DQN (**ALL**).
    * **Steven**

        * ‚ùå üöß Work-in-progress, will delivery by on 2019-07-24.
        * ‚úÖ Basic DQN learned (**ALL**)


### 2019-07-11 | Kick-off briefing | Anul Sinha, Henry, Jian, Steven
* Anul gave a presentation of his `forex` side-project, mainly regarding the method of interaction with OANDA, his model try-out, and why he abandoned this project.
* Due to the lacks of documentation of Anul's work, we decided to not to take over his project (also because he has moved on to a more combined design base on his `forex`), but to build our own bot. However, we will take his code as an important reference, especially regarding the OANDA API part and model environment setup.

## Development Journal

### 2019-07-23 | Implemented custom exceptions handling, and stand alone training input portal | Henry
* Now all input should goes to ‚Äî or in a form which is similar to ‚Äî `train_interface.py` with the login info saved in `config.py`
* Custom exceptions handling implemented, e.g.

```
During self.get_arena()
	<class 'trade_interface.OI_Onanda_Error'> is raised due to: {"errorMessage":"Insufficient authorization to perform request."}

During self.get_currency_pairs()
	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised due to: No currency pair(s) between ('USD', 'JAY') from Oanda

During self.account_input_eval()
	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised as: Invalid Oanda granularity input, self.request_interval: H20.

During self.account_input_eval()
	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised as: Invalid account input, self.currency_balance['USD'] must be >= 0 (currently -10).

During self.execute_trade()
	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Execution_Error'> is raised as: USD balance < 0 after trade action #0 (currently -127412000.00000001).

During self.execute_trade()
	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Execution_Error'> is raised as: _time 2019-01-01T22:29:00.000000000Z is earlier than pervious action's trade_time 2019-01-01T22:30:00.000000000Z in log.

During self.account_input_eval()
	<class 'trade_interface.TI_Account_Error'> is raised as: self.from_time 2019-01-01T00:00:00Z is earlier than self.to_time 2018-01-02T00:00:00Z.
```
* Add feature to retrieve one trade action by `action_id` from `trade_log`.

### 2019-07-17 | Developed wrapper functions output pricing record | Henry
* Developed a set of wrapper functions in `oanda_interface.py`, which can interact with `oandapyV20` API and output pricing record according to user requested currency pair, start time, end time, interval.
* Output is available in both `DataFrame` and CSV file with command line confirmation on both request and export stage:

```
