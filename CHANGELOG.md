## Broadcasts

### 2019-07-10 | A short style guide for updating this `CHANGELOG.md`.
* The `CHANGELOG.md` has three sections.
    * **Broadcasts**: Briefing of upcoming events or reminders (like this one).
    * **Scrum Meetings**: Summaries for scrum meetings.
    * **Development Journal**: Records for development updates.
* For the sake of consistency, I suggest we update this `CHANGELOG.md` in a date descending order (new-to-old) with a headline format of `YYYY-MM-DD | Highlight, Name`. Note the `Highlight` and `Name` parts can be omitted if not applicable, e.g.
    * This broadcast headline, which omits `Name`.
    * Under **Development Journal** as `2019-04-10, Henry Zhong`, which omits `Highlight`.
